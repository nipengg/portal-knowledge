Setup
---
1. Create a database named `laravelqa_db` in your MySQL/MariaDB database server
2. Setup your LAMP environment and copy the project folders and files into your `public_html` folder
3. Configure your hostname and database credential in the `.env` file
4. Run `php artisan migrate` to setup the database
5. If you are using a Linux-based machine, you need to give the following permission
    - `chmod -R 755 laravelqa`
    - `chmod -R o+w laravelqa/storage`
6. Done!

What's next
-----------
This is a very-simple project that I worked on in a short period of time to learn and get myself familiar with Laravel 5.

Currently, I have no plan to work on this, for an indefinite amount of time. Feel free to fork the repo to modify it as you see fit.
